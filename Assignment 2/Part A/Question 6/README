To run the programs, you need to run Router, Server and Send_udp passing localhost as command line parameter.
Then, the client begin to send the message you want to.
Press 'enter' to send the message from the Client to the server, next, input a number between 0 and 1.
The Router receives the message and the number. 
The Router, chooses a number by a random function, and if the number choosed is higher than the number received, the Router doesn't send the message.
Else, the router sends the message.
Then, the Server receives (or not) the message from the Router, and you need to input a message. 
Press 'enter' to send the message from the Server to the Client.
The Router receives the message from the Server and, sends the message to the Client.
And so work.
When you send the message "exit", the codes stop.
