In this project there are :
A folder with all the python codes :
A python code PortScanning (Detect the open port of the localhost by default).
A python code PasswordGuessing (Trace the password of the localhost by default).
Attention, on this code we used two txt files, the first passwords,txt, which include numerous passwords, and a
second file passwordsTest, which include approximately 10 passwords include the password of the localost (to check if the code truly work).
A python code stealthy FTP (Steal a file from the target)
